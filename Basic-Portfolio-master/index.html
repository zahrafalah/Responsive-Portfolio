                <p>I was born and grew up in Tehran, Iran. I got my Bachelors degree in Chemistry in 2011 and right after that, I started working as an author of supplementary books for highschool students in a private company called <a href="http://www.meraat.ir/">"Meraat".</a> In 2015, I decided to migrate to the United States to start a new life here. I came to U.S. and tried to get into school and follow my dreams and becoming a scientist. Since October 2016, I am working in a chemistry research laboratory at ASU and working on the "Catalysis of dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and hydrosilanes". My curiosity towards computer sciences led me to this fantastic bootcamp, in which I can learn Web-development as a new skill to become a full-stack developer. I found it both challenging and rewarding at the same time and this is why I enjoy it so much. </p>
